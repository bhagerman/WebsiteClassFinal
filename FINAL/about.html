        <h1>&#149; 	About &#149; 	</h1> 
<p>ST’s War TD is a Warcraft III Custom Map designed within the World Editor, a 3D game engine toolset. <br /><br />
 

Tower Defense games had been around for years, on the web as Flash games and even in 1999’s Starcraft. Creating a Tower Defense game is simple in theory, but to make your game worth playing, it was necessary to have a twist within this oversaturated genre. This is why I fundamentally changed the way a multiplayer Tower Defense would work, instead of losing “lives” or having the game “end” if you let one computer controlled creep pass through your defense, you would instead be negatively impacted by that leak, but the game would not be over. I set out to bring a “tug of war” mentality, to create dynamic competition between the opposing teams of players, but at the same time you wouldn’t only face your opponent player; you’d also have to defend against the onslaught of the computer itself.



The project was initially started on January 1st, of 2010. War TD was quickly brought to “Proof of Concept” status; by January 10th the game’s engine was complete, and the game could officially be considered playable. With only 3 different units to defend against, and only 2 towers to actually place on the map, there was not much content to look at, but it was playable. This was but the infancy, soon it would grow into one of the most played games on Warcraft III.</p>

<p>Through more hard work and dedicated testing, the content expanded and the first fully playable version, “ST’s War TD .08a” was ready to be critiqued by the public. Initial impressions were positive, but lack of content was holding the project back from its goal of greatness. </p>
     
<p>Over the months, from February up through May, major content additions and feature refinement was implemented. The game was past its adolescence, it had hit its prime. By mid May, the statistic trackers were placing War TD in the top 4 most played custom game across all of the worlds severs on Warcraft III; most notably however is the face that within the continental US it hovered between second and third. This translated into about 65,000 games played every 2 weeks.</p>

<p>With the success of bringing competition, fast games, and deep strategy in both offense and defense, the game had held its popularity for months, even between long updates. By summer 2010 War TD was officially declared “complete” with its version 1.00 status. I continued to periodically update the game up until August 21st 2010, with a last-in-series version 1.3 status. Warcraft III’s popularity has dwindled, and so did War TD.  </p>
<p>As the crowning achievement of my four year experience in using the World Editor, I couldn’t have asked for more, with <font color="red">371 days of played time across the planet</font>, the game was more than just a custom project, it was the crowning jewel in the kingdom of Warcraft III before its inevitable downfall.</p>
