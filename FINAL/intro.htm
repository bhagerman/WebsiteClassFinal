        <h1>&#149; 	Introduction &#149; 	</h1> 
<p>ST’s War TD is an entirely “indie” custom project for the retail blockbuster hit, Warcraft III. The project was inspired by the “Tower Defense” genre of games.<br /><br />
 Except this time it’s not <span class="emphasis">just about you</span> and an intimate battle with the computer’s mindless drones that try to run pass your defenses!
You not only have to defend your city, you must rally forces to destroy your opponents.</p>
 <p>Oh, and did we mention those opponents are <span class="emphasis">real players as well</span>?</p>


<p>Introducing ST’s War TD: a unique and dynamic tower defense that pits you against the computer and real life players!</p>
 <h3>In battle, nothing goes according to plan.</h3> <br />

 You attempt to defend your lane from oncoming hordes of computer controlled units, and sure--your towers may be safe, but any unit you let by will attack your team’s town hall. 
 You bad guard you, letting the town get attacked. But never fear! There is redemption! As a unique twist to the classic Tower Defense, you not only defend, you hire forces to attack your enemy’s town hall. 
 Suddenly, you’re not just a lowly guard anymore. You’re a General AND an architect. It’s up to you and your allies to protect your city, but you’re also tasked with destroying your opponent’s. 
 Can you handle the stress of building management, <strong>and</strong> the responsibility of launching successful campaigns against your enemy? Only one way to find out, it’s time to fight.
<p style="text-align:center">Welcome to War TD, where you could be your nation’s <font color="green">hero</font>, or just another <font color="blue">unmarked grave</font>.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">Sidenote: This website was made December 2010. There used to be a livestream recorded video of the game here, too.</p>
